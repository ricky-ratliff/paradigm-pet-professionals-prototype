                    <h1>Professional Pet Dog Advice</h1>
                    <h2>Dog History</h2>
                    <p>The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as there
                        are
                        well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual
                        benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of having a companion as
                        well
                        as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators
                        such
                        as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles. If you have a dog, it is important to
                        make
                        sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
                        opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more information about how to care for
                        your
                        pets throughout the various stages of their lives.</p>

                    <h2>Diet & Exercise</h2>
                    <p>Throughout dogs&#39; lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies
                        should
                        be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three
                        to
                        six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six
                        months to one year old and finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. And a
                        dog&#39;s
                        typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The ASPCA says just
                        a 10
                        percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make
                        sure you keep your pooch hydrated!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep their organs healthy, as
                        well as sun and fresh air. The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
                        and
                        size differences, but generally a range of 30&#45;120 minutes of exercise is recommended per
                        day!
                        Can
                        you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading
                        this.
                        But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does not mean
                        you
                        are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a
                        variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not
                        pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require supervision.</p>

                    <h2>Grooming & Handling</h2>
                    <p>Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush frequently
                        to
                        reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
                        difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting
                        heavily
                        wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog&#39;s health but can be an exercise
                        depending on
                        how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a
                        rash.
                        Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic
                        reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your
                        dog,
                        you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup
                        with
                        one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach
                        under
                        the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest
                        and
                        rear as you lift.</p>

                    <h2>Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
                    <p>You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are
                        typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis,
                        rabies,
                        and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the environment in which the
                        dog
                        resides. Some of these include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira
                        bacteria.</p>
